# Particles

This directory will contain SpriteKit particle effect files:

- `FeatherExplosion.sks` - Feather particle explosion effect (planned)
- `CrumbBurst.sks` - Crumb burst particle effect (planned)

Currently, the game uses a simple procedural particle effect created with SKShapeNode.

TODO: Add your particle effect (.sks) files here if you want to enhance the visual effects.
